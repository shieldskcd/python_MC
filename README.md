# Python MasterClass with Tim Buchalka and Jean-Paul
This repository will be used to house the code I create as part of the Python MasterClass by Tim Buchalka from Udemy.com. As I make updates to this material, I will keep a running list below. 

## Course Progress
This list explains my current progress in the course. 
### Section 1
    1. This was mostly overview, not anything new to learn
### Section 2
    1. Installed Python 3.10 from Python.org
    2. Suggested I install IntelliJ IDEA but my computer won't allow this.
    3. Working with VSCode instead as it is very similar.
    4. Lesson 14 was unnecessarry because I am not using IntelliJ IDEA but I watched it anyway
### Section 3
    1. Created a new folder called HelloWorld and added a HelloWorld.py.
    2. Used print command to create my Hello World statement.
