# Python MasterClass with Tim Buchalka and Jean-Paul
This repository will be used to house the code I create as part of the Python MasterClass by Tim Buchalka from Udemy.com. As I make updates to this material, I will keep a running list below. 

## Course Progress
This list explains my current progress in the course. 
### Section 1
    1. This was mostly overview, not anything new to learn
### Section 2
    1. Installed Python 3.10 from Python.org
    2. Suggested I install IntelliJ IDEA but my computer won't allow this.
    3. Working with VSCode instead as it is very similar.
    4. Lesson 14 was unnecessarry because I am not using IntelliJ IDEA but I watched it anyway
### Section 3
    1. Created a new folder called HelloWorld and added a HelloWorld.py.
    2. Used print command to create my Hello World statement.
    3. Added more commands to the Hello World file to add, multiply, and even put in extra space
    4. Created a dictionary file (Dictionary.md) that will e used to track words and functions used in Python. 
    5. Created a new file that prints a string and then prints the results of a mathematic calculation.
    6. Created a new file that produces several strings and discussed concatenation
    7. Created an input field that will prompt user to input their name so that it can be added to the string that is printed.
    8. Created two versions of the printed value, one with a space and one without.
    9. We are now on module 3.19
