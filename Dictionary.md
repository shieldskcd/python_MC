# Python Course Dictionary
This dictionary will serve as a way of listing all the different terms and functions discusssed in the course organized alphabetically for easy review. 

## A
* **argument** - A value passed to a **function**, in order to give it values to work with.
                There may be no **arguments**, or there may be 1 or more. 
                Arguments appear in parentheses after the **function** name. 
                If there are no arguments, you *still* have to include the parentheses.

## B

## C
* **calling a function** - Using the **function** name to execute the function's code. 
                        When you **call** a function, you have to provide **arguments** that the function expects.
                        If it doesn't expect any arguments, don't put anything between the parentheses. 

* **concatenate** - Connecting to strings in Python together using a plus sign. For example: `print("hello" + " world")` will produce the single string of `hello world` because it is concatenating the two items.

## D

## E

## F
* **function** - A named block of code that we can call by using its name. 
                We can write our own functions, or we can use functions that are built into Python (such as **print**). 
                In Python, all functions **return** a value.
